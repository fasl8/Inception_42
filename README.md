# [Docker](https://learn.kodekloud.com/user/courses/docker-training-course-for-the-absolute-beginner):
  ## 1. [What is Docker](https://www.ibm.com/topics/docker)?
  - Docker is an open platform for developing, shipping, and running applications.
  - It allows developers to package applications and their dependencies into lightweight, standalone containers that can run anywhere.
 
  ## 2. Why Use Docker?
  1. Consistency Across Environments: Containers run consistently regardless of where they're deployed, ensuring that code works the same in development, testing, and production environments.
  2. Isolation: Each container runs independently, providing a clean and controlled environment for each application.
  3. Scalability: Docker makes it easy to scale applications up or down quickly, as needed.
  
  ## 3. Key Components of Docker:
  1. Docker Engine: The core software that enables containerization, which includes the Docker Daemon, REST API, and CLI.
  2. Docker Images: Read-only templates used to create containers. Images are created using Dockerfiles, which specify the environment needed for an application.
  3. Docker Containers: Running instances of Docker images. They are lightweight and include all necessary components, such as libraries and dependencies, to run applications.
  4. Docker Hub: A public registry where Docker images can be stored, shared, and accessed.
  
  ## 4. How Docker Works:
  - Developers write code locally and use Docker to build an image, which contains the app and its environment.
  - The image is pushed to a registry (like Docker Hub).
  - From the registry, images can be pulled to any server or environment, where they run as containers.
  
  ## 5. Benefits of Using Docker:
  - Efficiency: Containers are lightweight and use fewer resources than traditional VMs.
  - Speed: Fast startup and shutdown times.
  - Portability: Docker containers run on any system that supports Docker, making deployment flexible and versatile.
