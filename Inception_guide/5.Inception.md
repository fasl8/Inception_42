# Pre-configuring Docker

## Step 1: Install and configure sudo
- Docker generally requires superuser privileges to run. However, you can configure it to allow certain users to run Docker commands without needing root access every time.
- This can be done by adding users to the docker group or using sudo.
- In order for our user to be able to make such requests in the system, we edit the /etc/sudoers config:
``` nano /etc/sudoers ``` This file controls who can use sudo and how.

- Within the sudoers file, you will need to add an entry for your specific user.
![2](https://github.com/fasl8/Inception_42/blob/main/screenshot_step/5.inception/2.user.png)
- Save the changes and close the file, ^x, y, enter.
- This step is essential for granting the necessary permissions for the user to run Docker commands without needing to switch to the root account each time. This enhances security and convenience.
## Step 2: Adding a user to the docker group
- we will add our user to the ``` docker ``` group. This will allow the user to run Docker commands without needing to prefix every command with sudo, making Docker usage more convenient.
    ### 1. Install sudo
    - Before adding the user to the docker group, we need to ensure that sudo is installed and configured for convenience. Although Docker can technically be used without sudo, installing it allows us to manage the system more easily and securely.
    - This command installs the sudo package: ``` apt install sudo ```

    ### 2. Check Current Groups for the User
    - check what groups your user is currently part of. This ensures you know the existing groups and will be able to confirm the addition of the docker group later.
    - This command lists all the groups that your user currently belongs to: ``` groups <your_nickname> ```

    ### 3. Add User to Docker Group and Verify Group Addition
    - We add our user to the ``` docker ``` group using the ``` usermod ``` command.
    - By adding the user to the ``` docker ``` group, we allow them to run Docker commands without needing to use ``` sudo ```. The ``` -aG  ``` option ensures that the user is added to the docker group without being removed from any other groups they belong to. We use sudo here because modifying user groups requires administrator privileges.
    - We check the list of groups for our user again to verify that the docker group was successfully added. The ``` docker ``` group should now appear at the end of the list.

## Step 3: Testing the Docker Configuration
- we will test the configuration by running a simple Nginx container. This will help verify that Docker is working correctly and that port forwarding has been set up properly.
    ### 1. Switch to the User and Go to the Home Directory
    - switches to the specified user command : ``` su <your_nickname> ```
    - navigates to that user's home directory: ``` cd ~/ ```

    ### 2. Download a Simple Docker Configuration
    -  We need an example container to test whether Docker is working as expected. This configuration uses Nginx (a web server) to help us verify that Docker is properly set up, by running a basic web service inside a container.
    -  This command downloads a simple Nginx configuration stored in a GitHub repository: ``` git clone https://github.com/codesshaman/simple_docker_nginx_html.git ```
    ![7](https://github.com/fasl8/Inception_42/blob/main/screenshot_step/5.inception/7.simple_docker_nginx_html.png)
     ### 3. Run the Docker Container
     - moves into the folder we just downloaded, which contains the Docker configuration for running Nginx ``` cd simple_docker_nginx_html ```.
     -  starts the Docker container in detached mode (running in the background) using Docker Compose: ``` docker-compose up -d ```
     -  docker-compose reads the docker-compose.yml file in the current directory to build and start the container.
     -  The -d option runs the container in detached mode, meaning it continues to run in the background, so you can keep using the terminal.
     ![8](https://github.com/fasl8/Inception_42/blob/main/screenshot_step/5.inception/8.docker-compose.png)
    ### 4. Test the Running Container in the Browser
    -  we will verify that the Nginx container is running by accessing it via the web browser.
    -  Open your web browser(from chrom or VM)and go to: ``` http://127.0.0.1 ```
    -  ``` 127.0.0.1 ``` is the loopback address for the local machine, allowing us to connect to services running locally on the host.
    ![9](https://github.com/fasl8/Inception_42/blob/main/screenshot_step/5.inception/9.VM127.0.0.1.png)
    ![9](https://github.com/fasl8/Inception_42/blob/main/screenshot_step/5.inception/9.web127.0.0.1.png)
    - If you donâ€™t see the expected Nginx page, it means there may be issues with the port configuration.
        - Ensure that port 80 is open and not used by other applications or servers.
        - Go through previous steps to confirm that Docker and port forwarding were correctly set up.
        - Disable any other services or applications that might be using port 80.

## Step 4: Creating Project Directories and Files
- Here are the basic commands that we will use to create directories and files:
    - ``` mkdir ``` : Creates a directory.
    - ``` touch ```: Creates an empty file.
    - ``` cd ```: Changes the current directory to the specified path.
    - ``` cd .. ```: Moves up to the parent directory.
    - ``` pwd ```: Prints the current working directory.
    - ``` cd ~ ```: Returns to the home directory.
   ### 1.Creating a Script for Automation
    - Open a new file called make_directories.sh in the text editor nano: ``` nano make_directories.sh ```
    - We'll write a shell script inside this file, which will automatically create the directories and files for the project.
    - The script creates directories and files for the project, including Dockerfiles, configuration files, and environment files.
    - Copy the following code into the ``` make_directories.sh ``` file:

```
#!/bin/bash
mkdir project
mkdir project/srcs
touch project/Makefile
mkdir project/srcs/requirements
touch project/srcs/docker-compose.yml
touch project/srcs/.env
echo "DOMAIN_NAME=<your_nickname>.42.fr" > project/srcs/.env
echo "CERT_=./requirements/tools/<your_nickname>.42.fr.crt" >> project/srcs/.env
echo "KEY_=./requirements/tools/<your_nickname>.42.fr.key" >> project/srcs/.env
echo "DB_NAME=wordpress" >> project/srcs/.env
echo "DB_ROOT=rootpass" >> project/srcs/.env
echo "DB_USER=wpuser" >> project/srcs/.env
echo "DB_PASS=wppass" >> project/srcs/.env
mkdir project/srcs/requirements/bonus
mkdir project/srcs/requirements/mariadb
mkdir project/srcs/requirements/mariadb/conf
touch project/srcs/requirements/mariadb/conf/create_db.sh
mkdir project/srcs/requirements/mariadb/tools
echo "" > project/srcs/requirements/mariadb/tools/.gitkeep
touch project/srcs/requirements/mariadb/Dockerfile
touch project/srcs/requirements/mariadb/.dockerignore
echo ".git" > project/srcs/requirements/mariadb/.dockerignore
echo ".env" >> project/srcs/requirements/mariadb/.dockerignore
mkdir project/srcs/requirements/nginx
mkdir project/srcs/requirements/nginx/conf
touch project/srcs/requirements/nginx/conf/nginx.conf
mkdir project/srcs/requirements/nginx/tools
touch project/srcs/requirements/nginx/Dockerfile
echo ".git" > project/srcs/requirements/nginx/.dockerignore
echo ".env" >> project/srcs/requirements/nginx/.dockerignore
mkdir project/srcs/requirements/tools
mkdir project/srcs/requirements/wordpress
mkdir project/srcs/requirements/wordpress/conf
touch project/srcs/requirements/wordpress/conf/wp-config-create.sh
mkdir project/srcs/requirements/wordpress/tools
echo "" > project/srcs/requirements/wordpress/tools/.gitkeep
touch project/srcs/requirements/wordpress/Dockerfile
echo ".git" > project/srcs/requirements/wordpress/.dockerignore
echo ".env" >> project/srcs/requirements/wordpress/.dockerignore
```

> [!NOTE]  
> Both make_directories.sh and create_folders.sh refer to the same script. You can use either name, as they serve the same purpose. Just pick whichever you prefer.
- create a file with the .sh extension and put this code in it: ``` nano create_folders.sh ```
- gives the script execution permissions: ``` chmod +x nano create_folders.sh ```
- The ``` chmod +x ``` command allows the script to be run as a program.
- Run the script to create the directories and files: ``` ./create_folders.sh ```

   ### 2.Understanding the .gitkeep Files
    - In certain directories, the script creates empty .gitkeep files, such as in the tools directory.
    - The .gitkeep files are empty files used to ensure that Git tracks empty directories.
    - Git does not track empty directories by default, so we use .gitkeep as a placeholder. This ensures that the empty directories are still included when the project is uploaded to a repository.
