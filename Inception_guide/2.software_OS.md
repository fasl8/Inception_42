# Installing the necessary software in Debian
## Step 1. Login to the system
- After installation and first boot we will be asked to select our system:
![1](https://github.com/fasl8/Inception_42/blob/main/screenshot_step/2.software_os/1.system.png)
- Let's boot as superuser by entering the username root and password.

>[!NOTE]
> When entering a password, the password itself will not be displayed on the screen. This is normal and is done for security purposes.
## Step 2: Update repository lists
- go to the root ``` su - ```
- Let's update the repositories with the command apt update:

>[!WARNING]
> if you find [error](https://github.com/fasl8/Inception_42/blob/main/screenshot_step/2.software_os/4.error_apt.png) in this step that becuase you are not in the root
## Step 3. Installing applications
- we install the applications we need using the following command:
``` apt install -y sudo ufw docker docker-compose make openbox xinit kitty firefox-esr ```
- We will enter this command manually, as we cannot copy-paste into the virtual machine. Later, we will open ports and connect to the virtual machine via console, as if it were a local server.

>[!WARNING]
> if you make a [mistake](https://github.com/fasl8/Inception_42/blob/main/screenshot_step/2.software_os/6.error_package.png) when entering this command, the system will tell us the name of the package/packages in whose name we made a mistake, We correct the package name and start the installation.
## Step 4. Launch the openbox graphical environment
- check the software we installed.
- let's launch the openbox graphical environment.
- The x-server is responsible for graphics in Linux. We launch it with the command ``` startx ```
![5](https://github.com/fasl8/Inception_42/blob/main/screenshot_step/2.software_os/7.startx.png)
- We will see a black screen.
![6](https://github.com/fasl8/Inception_42/blob/main/screenshot_step/2.software_os/8.black_screen.png)
- If we hover over this black square and right-click on it, we'll see a pop-up menu for launching applications. This is how the lightweight openbox environment works. Let's launch the command line inside our GUI:
![7](https://github.com/fasl8/Inception_42/blob/main/screenshot_step/2.software_os/9.openbox.png)
- we have the option to work either through a GUI terminal or through a TTY terminal.
![8](https://github.com/fasl8/Inception_42/blob/main/screenshot_step/2.software_os/10.GUI.png)
- Let's launch our web browser to check its operation. To do this, select the second item Web Browserin the application launch menu:
![9](https://github.com/fasl8/Inception_42/blob/main/screenshot_step/2.software_os/11.web_browser.png)
- The ObConf utility (item four) will help in configuring our GUI, allowing you to change the theme or set the wallpaper.
![10](https://github.com/fasl8/Inception_42/blob/main/screenshot_step/2.software_os/12.firefox.png)
- we have checked all the software we need. Now we can exit the GUI by selecting the last menu itemExit
![10](https://github.com/fasl8/Inception_42/blob/main/screenshot_step/2.software_os/13.exit.png)
