# Create Mariadb container

## Step 1: Creating the Container for MariaDB
  - We are creating a container image for MariaDB, open-source database server used in many web applications, including WordPress. 
  
  - This container will host our database, which will store all the necessary data for WordPress.
  
  1. ``` cd ~/project/srcs ```
  2. ``` nano requirements/mariadb/Dockerfile ```
  3.  
```
    FROM alpine:3.16

    RUN apk update && apk add --no-cache mariadb mariadb-client

    RUN mkdir /var/run/mysqld; \
        chmod 777 /var/run/mysqld; \
        { echo '[mysqld]'; \
        echo 'skip-host-cache'; \
        echo 'skip-name-resolve'; \
        echo 'bind-address=0.0.0.0'; \
        } | tee  /etc/my.cnf.d/docker.cnf; \
        sed -i "s|skip-networking|skip-networking=0|g" \
      /etc/my.cnf.d/mariadb-server.cnf

    RUN mysql_install_db --user=mysql --datadir=/var/lib/mysql

    EXPOSE 3306

    USER mysql
    COPY tools/db.sh .
    ENTRYPOINT  ["sh", "db.sh"]
    CMD ["/usr/bin/mysqld", "--skip-log-error"]
```

- install the ``` mariadb ``` server and ``` mariadb-client ``` for database management.
- ``` --no-cache ``` flag prevents Docker from storing unnecessary cache, keeping the image small.
- create the necessary directory for MariaDB's socket files at ``` /var/run/mysqld ```.
- give full access (chmod 777) to ensure MariaDB has permission to write to this folder.
- use the ``` tee ``` command to write a minimal configuration for MariaDB into the Docker image, setting options like ``` skip-host-cache ``` and ``` skip-name-resolve ```.
- The ``` sed ``` command modifies the ``` mariadb-server.cnf ``` file, ensuring MariaDB listens on all network interfaces (0.0.0.0).
- ``` mysql_install_db ``` is run to initialize the MariaDB database and create the default database structures.
- make sure that port 3306 (the default MariaDB port) is accessible from outside the container.
- run MariaDB as the ``` mysql ``` user for security reasons.
- ``` db.sh ``` script handles the database setup, which we will create in the next steps.

## Step 2: Creating the Script to Set Up the Database
- We are creating a bash script that will initialize the MariaDB database and create a new database for WordPress.
- Rather than setting up the database manually every time the container is started, this script automates the creation and initialization process.
1. ``` nano requirements/mariadb/conf/create_db.sh ```
2. 
    ```
    #!bin/sh

    if [ ! -d "/var/lib/mysql/mysql" ]; then

        chown -R mysql:mysql /var/lib/mysql

        # init database
        mysql_install_db --basedir=/usr --datadir=/var/lib/mysql --user=mysql --rpm

        tfile=`mktemp`
        if [ ! -f "$tfile" ]; then
           return 1
     fi
    fi

    if [ ! -d "/var/lib/mysql/wordpress" ]; then

        cat << EOF > /tmp/create_db.sql
    USE mysql;
    FLUSH PRIVILEGES;
    DELETE FROM mysql.user WHERE User='';
    DROP DATABASE test;
    DELETE FROM mysql.db WHERE Db='test';
    DELETE FROM mysql.user WHERE User='root' AND Host NOT IN ('localhost', '127.0.0.1', '::1');
    ALTER USER 'root'@'localhost' IDENTIFIED BY '${DB_ROOT}';
    CREATE DATABASE ${DB_NAME} CHARACTER SET utf8 COLLATE utf8_general_ci;
    CREATE USER '${DB_USER}'@'%' IDENTIFIED by '${DB_PASS}';
    GRANT ALL PRIVILEGES ON wordpress.* TO '${DB_USER}'@'%';
    FLUSH PRIVILEGES;
    EOF

        # run the SQL script
        /usr/bin/mysqld --user=mysql --bootstrap < /tmp/create_db.sql
        rm -f /tmp/create_db.sql
    fi
    ```
- check if the MariaDB system database (mysql) exists. If it doesn't, it means MariaDB hasn't been initialized yet, so we initialize it.
- ``` chown -R mysql:mysql ``` command ensures that the mysql user has ownership of the database files.
- If the wordpress database doesn’t already exist, we create it by running SQL commands inside the script.
- SQL commands are written into a temporary file (create_db.sql) and executed. These commands:
    - Secure the database by removing unnecessary users and test databases.
    - Set the root user password using the ${DB_ROOT} environment variable.
    - Create a new database ${DB_NAME} for WordPress.
    - Create a user ${DB_USER} with a password ${DB_PASS} and grant this user privileges on the wordpress database.

## Step 3: Modifying the Dockerfile to Use the Script
- We are modifying the Dockerfile to copy the script into the container and run it during the build process.
- This ensures that when the container is built, the necessary database and users are set up automatically without needing manual intervention.
1. ``` nano requirements/mariadb/Dockerfile ```
2. Add the following lines at the appropriate section:
    ```
    COPY requirements/mariadb/conf/create_db.sh .
    RUN sh create_db.sh && rm create_db.sh
    ```
3. Before we can run the database setup script, we need to ensure that all necessary environment variables for the database creation are passed to the Docker image. These variables will define the database name, user, and password,  the environment variables will come from a ``` .env ```  file.
    - We include the ``` ARG ``` instructions to ensure that when Docker builds the image, it knows what environment variables to expect. These variables will only be available at build time, meaning they won’t be stored in the final image, which adds an extra layer of security. 
    - we will add the following lines at the beginning of the file:
        ```
        ARG DB_NAME \
        DB_USER \
        DB_PASS \
        DB_ROOT
        ```
```
FROM alpine:3.16

ARG DB_NAME \
    DB_USER \
    DB_PASS \
    DB_ROOT

RUN apk update && apk add --no-cache mariadb mariadb-client

RUN mkdir /var/run/mysqld; \
    chmod 777 /var/run/mysqld; \
    { echo '[mysqld]'; \
      echo 'skip-host-cache'; \
      echo 'skip-name-resolve'; \
      echo 'bind-address=0.0.0.0'; \
    } | tee  /etc/my.cnf.d/docker.cnf; \
    sed -i "s|skip-networking|skip-networking=0|g" \
      /etc/my.cnf.d/mariadb-server.cnf

RUN mysql_install_db --user=mysql --datadir=/var/lib/mysql

EXPOSE 3306

COPY requirements/mariadb/conf/create_db.sh .
RUN sh create_db.sh && rm create_db.sh
USER mysql
CMD ["/usr/bin/mysqld", "--skip-log-error"]
```
## Step 4: Docker Compose Configuration for MariaDB
- We will configure Docker Compose to build the MariaDB container and pass the required environment variables.
- Docker Compose allows us to manage multiple services (MariaDB, Nginx) together in a single file.
- By passing environment variables here, we avoid hardcoding sensitive information like database names and passwords directly into the Dockerfile.
1. ``` nano docker-compose.yml ```
2. Add the following section for MariaDB:
```
  mariadb:
    build:
      context: .
      dockerfile: requirements/mariadb/Dockerfile
      args:
        DB_NAME: ${DB_NAME}
        DB_USER: ${DB_USER}
        DB_PASS: ${DB_PASS}
        DB_ROOT: ${DB_ROOT}
    container_name: mariadb
    ports:
      - "3306:3306"
    volumes:
      - db-volume:/var/lib/mysql
    restart: always
```

## Step 5: Testing the Database Setup
- Ensures that the database was created successfully and that our configuration and scripts worked as expected.
1. Start the container: ``` docker-compose up ```
2. Access the MariaDB shell: ``` docker exec -it mariadb mysql -u root ```
3. Run the following SQL command to list the databases: ``` show databases; ```
4. Check that the output includes the wordpress database.
5. We exit the environment with the exit command or by pressing Ctrl+D.
- If the wordpress database is listed, congratulations! You've successfully set up MariaDB in Docker. If not, review the steps to ensure the script ran correctly and the environment variables were passed properly.
- try to use ``` docker exec -it mariadb mysql ```
