# Port forwarding in a virtual system
## Step 1: Setting up ssh configuration
- Log in as superuser and open the file/etc/ssh/sshd_config
![1](https://github.com/fasl8/Inception/blob/main/screenshot_step/3.Port_forwarding/1.nano_sshd_config.png)
- We change the port to 42 (on a school Mac, for example, 22 is already occupied by the host machine's ssh and it won't be possible to connect via it) and allow logging in as the superuser
- Disable login by key and confirm login by password:

- save the configuration and restart the ssh and sshd services

## Step 2. Setting up the firewall
- we have already installed the ufw firewall (more precisely, ufw is an add-on to the iptables firewall, but within the framework of our task we will not delve into these technologies).
- open our port 42 for ssh in the firewall, as well as ports 80 and 443 for the website.
- launch our firewall with the command ufw enable, then we allow each port with the directive ufw allow N, where N is the port number:
- Open ports can be viewed using the commandufw status

- the system settings are complete, you need to turn off the virtual machine with the commandshutdown now
- The command shutdownwill shut down the server in a minute, so we use it shutdown nowfor immediate termination:

## Step 3. Port forwarding
- It is not enough to open ports on the guest machine, you also need to redirect traffic from the host to the guest. Traffic going through certain ports must be redirected by forwarding ports from the guest machine to the host.
- In Virtualbox, go to settings -> network -> advanced -> port forwarding, and enter the following rules:

## Step 4. Login via the host OS terminal
To log in as a regular user, use the username we created:
``` ssh <your_nickname>@localhost -p 42 ```
We click yes to accept the settings in known_hosts, enter our password and we are on the guest machine!
