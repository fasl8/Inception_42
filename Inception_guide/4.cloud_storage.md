# Storing configuration in the 4.cloud

- When working on a project, there may be a need to transfer the configuration to another computer. 
- To transfer a project, you can use a phone, flash drive or 4.cloud.

## Step 1. Learn how to create snapshots
- create snapshots - snapshots of the system state, and save the system along with them.
- Snapshots allow you to capture the current state of a VM, so you can revert back to that point later if needed.
- The virtual machine must be turned off to create a snapshot!
- We go into virtualbox and go to the "snapshots" menu ["take"](https://github.com/fasl8/Inception/blob/main/screenshot_step/4.cloud_storage/1.take.png).

- This way we get a snapshot of our current changes:

- If something goes wrong, you won't necessarily have to delete and redo the configuration; you can simply roll back to the previous working configuration.
## Step 2. Find the installed configuration
- We go to the folder on goinfre, where our configuration is stored. If we look at the file sizes, we will find that the .vhd disk weighs more than 2 gigabytes , and most modern 4.cloud storages do not support files larger than two gigabytes.

## Step 3. Compress large files
