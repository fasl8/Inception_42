# Changing the local domain and installing certificates

###  Step 1: Install ``` mkcert ```:
   
   - We need to install a self-signed SSL certificate to use HTTPS (port 443) and change the local domain to <your_nickname>.42.fr.
   - For local development, we use self-signed certificates, and the mkcert utility is perfect for generating them.
   1. Update repository list: ``` sudo apt update -y ```

   2. Install necessary utilities: ``` sudo apt install -y wget curl libnss3-tools ```
   3. Download the ``` mkcert ``` binary: ``` curl -s https://api.github.com/repos/FiloSottile/mkcert/releases/latest | grep browser_download_url | grep linux-amd64 | cut -d '"' -f 4 | wget -qi - ```
   4. Rename the downloaded file make it executable: ``` mv mkcert-v*-linux-amd64 mkcert ``` 
   5. make it executable: ``` chmod a+x mkcert ```
   6. Move ``` mkcert ``` to the working directory: ``` sudo mv mkcert /usr/local/bin/ ```
   7. Verify installation: ``` mkcert --version ```

### Step 2: Change the Local Domain:
- To make local development more convenient, we’ll change the alias of the localhost (127.0.0.1) domain to e <your_nickname>.42.fr.
 1. Edit the /etc/hosts file: ``` sudo nano /etc/hosts ```
![2](https://github.com/fasl8/Inception_42/blob/main/screenshot_step/6.certificate/2.hosts.png)
 2. Test by running your container: ``` cd ~/simple_docker_nginx_html/ && docker-compose up -d ```
 3. Start the X server (for graphical interface): ``` sudo startx ```
   - display server responsible for managing the graphical user interface (GUI) on Linux systems. It provides the environment where desktop applications can display windows, interact with input devices (mouse, keyboard), and handle graphical rendering.
   - You won't see the graphical desktop immediately in the terminal where you typed the command. Instead, the graphical interface will open in a new window on the screen.
   - When you terminate the X session using Ctrl + C in the terminal, the GUI session will close, and you'll return to the terminal interface.

- graphical environment in the virtualbox window. Turn on the web browser and enter the address http://<your_nickname>.42.fr
![4](https://github.com/fasl8/Inception_42/blob/main/screenshot_step/6.certificate/4.VM.42.fr.png)
- As we can see, we have a local domain, but there is no certificate.

### Step 3. Obtaining a certificate
- We will now generate a self-signed certificate using mkcert and place it in the appropriate directory.
 1. Navigate to the tools folder: ``` cd ~/project/srcs/requirements/tools/ ```
 2. Generate a certificate for your local domain: ``` mkcert <your_nickname>.42.fr ```
    - This creates two files:
       - ``` <your_nickname>.42.fr.pem ```: The certificate file
       - ``` <your_nickname>.42.fr-key.pem ```: The private key for the certificate.

 3. Rename the certificate files for Nginx:

``` mv <your_nickname>.42.fr-key.pem <your_nickname>.42.fr.key ```

``` mv <your_nickname>.42.fr.pem <your_nickname>.42.fr.crt ```

### Step 4: Reconfigure NGINX for HTTPS
- Now we will configure the NGINX web server to use our self-signed certificate and enable HTTPS.
- By default, NGINX does not serve HTTPS. We need to modify its configuration to serve traffic securely.
 1. Edit the NGINX configuration: ``` nano ~/simple_docker_nginx_html/nginx/conf.d/nginx.conf ```
 2. Replace the existing configuration with the following
```
server {
    # Listen on HTTP port
    listen      80;
    # Listen on HTTPS port - SSL
    listen      443 ssl;
    # Specify the domain we will be working with:
    server_name  <your_nickname>.42.fr www.<your_nickname>.42.fr;
    # Specify the root directory of the project:
    root    /var/www/public/html;
    # The next section is commented out for
    # proper operation with the host machine.
    # Redirect HTTP to HTTPS:
    #if ($scheme = 'http') {
    #    return 301 https://<your_nickname>.42.fr$request_uri;
    #}
    # Specify the path to the certificate and key:
    ssl_certificate     /etc/nginx/ssl/<your_nickname>.42.fr.crt;
    ssl_certificate_key /etc/nginx/ssl/<your_nickname>.42.fr.key;
    # Specify supported TLS protocols:
    ssl_protocols            TLSv1.2 TLSv1.3;
    # Specify caching options and timeouts:
    ssl_session_timeout 10m;
    keepalive_timeout 70;
    # Instruct the server which file extensions
    # to look for in our root folder (root)
    location / {
        try_files $uri /index.html;
    }
}
```

 3. Now we need to go to the test project folder and stop the container: ``` cd ~/simple_docker_nginx_html/ && docker-compose down ```
 4. Update the Docker Compose file: ``` nano docker-compose.yml ```
    - In the volumes section, map the SSL certificates to the correct location:
 ```
 volumes:
    - /home/${USER}/project/srcs/requirements/tools:/etc/nginx/ssl
 ```
   
   - Open port 443 in the Docker Compose file by adding the line "443:443" under ports.

## Step 5: Launch the Project with HTTPS
-  let’s bring up the project with Docker and test the HTTPS setup.
 1. Start Docker: ``` docker-compose up -d ```
 2. Access the project in the browser: Open a browser and navigate to ``` https://<your_nickname>.42.fr ```
 3. You will see a warning that the certificate is not trusted.
   - The certificate is self-signed, meaning it wasn’t issued by a trusted authority. You can safely ignore this for local development.
   - Click "Advanced" and select "Proceed to site".

## Step 6: Accessing the Project on the Host Machine
- If you want to access the project directly on your host machine, use the IP address 127.0.0.1. This will work because the nginx config supports local access via HTTP.
- Open your browser and go to https://127.0.0.1.
