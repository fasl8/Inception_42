# INCEPTION QUESTIONS

## Project overview

## 1. How Docker and docker compose work?
- Docker and Docker-Compose are powerful tools that help developers package, distribute, and manage applications using containers.
- Docker is a platform that simplifies the process of creating, deploying, and running applications in isolated containers. Containers are lightweight environments that package an application and its dependencies, ensuring consistency across different systems. Docker uses images as blueprints for containers, and these images include everything needed to run the app, like code, libraries, and system tools. Containers can be easily created, started, stopped, and moved across different environments. 

- Docker-Compose, is a tool for managing multi-container applications. It uses a file (docker-compose.yml) to define and configure services, networks, and volumes, enabling multiple containers to run and interact seamlessly. Each service represents a different container, such as a web app or database, and Compose automatically sets up networking between them. With simple commands like docker-compose up and docker-compose down, you can easily start and stop all services in a project. This makes Docker-Compose perfect for managing complex apps that require multiple containers working together.

## 2. The difference between a Docker image used with docker compose and without docker compose

| **Aspect**                      | **Docker (Without Docker Compose)**                               | **Docker (With Docker Compose)**                           |
|----------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Focus**                        | Single container at a time                                       | Multiple containers together (as services)                 |
| **Setup**                        | Manual configuration (ports, volumes, networks) for each container | Pre-configured in the `docker-compose.yml` file             |
| **Management**                   | Individual `docker run` commands for each container               | Manage all containers with `docker-compose up` and `down`   |
| **Complexity**                   | Requires separate commands for each container with specific flags | Simplifies management of complex, multi-container setups    |
| **Networking**                   | Networking between containers needs manual configuration         | Automatically sets up networks between services             |
| **Use Case**                     | Simple, single-container applications                            | Applications requiring multiple containers (web app + DB)   |
| **Ease of Use**                  | More effort to manage multiple containers                        | Streamlined management for multi-container environments     |

## 3. The benefit of Docker compared to VMs
- Docker containers start faster since they don't require a full OS.
- Containers share the host OS kernel, using fewer resources than VMs.
- Docker offers process-level isolation, while VMs provide full OS-level isolation.
- Containers are easily portable across environments; VMs may face compatibility issues.
- Containers can start almost instantly, whereas VMs take longer to boot.
- Containers are more space-efficient due to shared layers; VMs need more disk space.
- Docker has minimal overhead compared to the higher overhead of VMs.
- Docker enables faster deployment and scaling than VMs.
- Managing containers is simpler than managing multiple VMs.
- Docker is great for microservices and CI/CD; VMs are better for fully isolated OS environments.

## 4. The pertinence of the directory structure required for this project (an example is provided in the subject's PDF file).
- The directory structure of this project is essential for organization and ease of management. The root directory contains a Makefile for build automation and a "srcs" subdirectory that centralizes the configuration files, such as docker-compose.yml and .env. The "srcs" directory further breaks down into specific application components like mariadb, nginx, tools, and wordpress, each containing its own Dockerfile and .dockerignore file.

- The .env file is particularly important as it holds environment variables used by both the docker-compose.yml file and the Dockerfiles. These variables define critical configurations such as the domain name, MySQL setup parameters, and certificate paths. This structured approach keeps all components organized and easily accessible, facilitating the development, deployment, and management of the application.

# Simple setup

## 1. Ensure that NGINX can be accessed by port 443 only. Once done, open the page. 2. Ensure that a SSL/TLS certificate is used.
- Open your NGINX configuration file.
- Look for the line: ``` listen 443 ssl; ```
- Ensure SSL certificate paths are correctly set.
- Open a web browser.
- Enter the URL: ``` https://login.42.fr ``` or ``` https://www.login.42.fr ```

## 3.  Ensure that the WordPress website is properly installed and configured (you shouldn't see the WordPress Installation page). 
- To access it, open https://login.42.fr (https://login.42.fr) in your browser, where login is the login of the evaluated student.
- You shouldn't be able to access the site via http://login.42.fr (http://login.42.fr). 
- If something doesn't work as expected, the evaluation process ends now.

# Docker Basics
## 1. Start by checking the Dockerfiles. 
- There must be one Dockerfile per service.
- Ensure that the Dockerfiles are not empty files. If it's not the case or if a Dockerfile is missing, the evaluation process ends now.

## 2. Make sure the evaluated student has written their own Dockerfiles and built their own Docker images.
- Indeed,it is forbidden to use ready-made ones or to use services such as DockerHub.

## 3. Ensure that every container is built from the penultimate stable version of Alpine/Debian.
- If a Dockerfile does not start with 'FROM alpine:X.X.X' or 'FROM debian:XXXXX', or any other local image, the evaluation process ends now.

## 4. The Docker images must have the same name as their corresponding service. Otherwise, the evaluation process ends now.

## 5. Ensure that the Makefile has set up all the services via docker compose.
- This means that the containers musthave been built using docker compose and that no crash happened. Otherwise, the evaluation process ends.

# Docker Network
## 1. Ensure that docker-network is used by checking the docker-compose.yml file. Then run the 'docker network ls' command to verify that a network is visible.

## 2. The evaluated student has to give you a simple explanation of docker-network. If any of the above points is not correct, the evaluation process ends now.
- Docker networking is a system that enables communication between Docker containers and external systems. It offers various types of networks, such as bridge (the default for inter-container communication on the same host)
- The bridge network in Docker allows multiple containers on the same host to communicate with each other using private IP addresses

# NGINX with SSL/TLS
## 1. Ensure that there is a Dockerfile.

## 2. Using the 'docker compose ps' command, ensure that the container was created (using the flag '-p' is authorized if necessary).

## 3. Try to access the service via http (port 80) and verify that you cannot connect.

## 4. Open https://login.42.fr/ (https://login.42.fr/) in your browser, where login is the login of the evaluated student.
- The displayed page must be the configured WordPress website (you shouldn't see the WordPress Installation page).

## 5. The use of a TLS v1.2/v1.3 certificate is mandatory and must be demonstrated.
- The SSL/TLS certificate doesn't have to be recognized. A self-signed certificate warning may appear.
- If any of the above points is not clearly explained and correct, the evaluation process ends now.

# WordPress with php-fpm and its volume
## 1. Ensure that there is a Dockerfile.
## 2. Ensure that there is no NGINX in the Dockerfile.
## 3. Using the 'docker compose ps' command, ensure that the container was created (using the flag '-p' is authorized if necessary).

## 4. Ensure that there is a Volume. To do so: Run the command 'docker volume ls' then 'docker volume inspect <volume name>'. Verify that the result in the standard output contains the path '/home/login/data/', where login is the login of the evaluated student.

## 5. Ensure that you can add a comment using the available WordPress user.

## 6. Sign in with the administrator account to access the Administration dashboard. 
- The Admin username must not include 'admin' or 'Admin' (e.g., admin, administrator, Admin-login, admin-123, and so forth).
 
## 7. From the Administration dashboard, edit a page. Verify on the website that the page has been updated. If any of the above points is not correct, the evaluation process ends now.

# MariaDB and its volume
## 1. Ensure that there is a Dockerfile.
## 2. Ensure that there is no NGINX in the Dockerfile.
## 3. Using the 'docker compose ps' command, ensure that the container was created (using the flag '-p' is authorized if necessary).

## 4. Ensure that there is a Volume. To do so: Run the command 'docker volume ls' then 'docker volume inspect <volume name>'. Verify that the result in the standard output contains the path '/home/login/data/', where login is the login of the evaluated student.
 
## 5. The evaluated student must be able to explain you how to login into the database. Verify that the database is not empty. If any of the above points is not correct, the evaluation process ends now.

#  Persistence!
## This part is pretty straightforward. You have to reboot the virtual machine. Once it has restarted, launch docker compose again. Then, verify that everything is functional, and that both WordPress and MariaDB are configured. The changes you made previously to the WordPress website should still be here. If any of the above points is not correct, the evaluation process ends now.
