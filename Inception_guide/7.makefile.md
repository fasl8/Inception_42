# Creating a Makefile
- The Makefile simplifies common Docker operations such as starting, stopping, and rebuilding containers, as well as performing cleanups.

## Step 1: Find the Name of Your Container
- Before we start, we need to know the name of our container so that we can refer to it throughout the Makefile.
- This is important because Docker needs to know which container to start, stop, or rebuild.
``` cd ~/simple_docker_nginx_html/ && cat docker-compose.yml ```

## Step 2: Set the Variable
-  create a Makefile in your project directory. We'll define a variable for the container name, which makes it easier to reference later in the file.
``` nano ~/simple_docker_nginx_html/Makefile ```
- Set the variable in the Makefile: ``` name = simple_nginx_html ```

## Step 3: Launch the Configuration
- define the all section in the Makefile, which will run the docker-compose command to launch the container.
- The docker-compose up -d command starts the container in detached mode (runs in the background). Using -f ./docker-compose.yml tells Docker to use the configuration file located in the current directory.
```
all:
    @printf "Launching configuration ${name}...\n"
    @docker-compose -f ./docker-compose.yml up -d
```

## Step 4: Build the Configuration
- add the ability to build the container. This is necessary when you've made changes to your Dockerfile or project files and need to rebuild the container.
- This command adds the --build flag, which forces Docker to rebuild the container even if it already exists.
```
build:
    @printf "Building configuration ${name}...\n"
    @docker-compose -f ./docker-compose.yml up -d --build
```

## Step 5: Stop the Configuration
- add a command to stop the running container. This is useful when you're done testing or want to perform maintenance.
- The docker-compose down command stops and removes the container, cleaning up the environment.
```
down:
    @printf "Stopping configuration ${name}...\n"
    @docker-compose -f ./docker-compose.yml down
```

## Step 6: Rebuild the Configuration
- If you want to stop, rebuild, and start the container in one step, we can define a re section that combines down and build actions.
- This first runs the down command to stop the container, then immediately rebuilds and starts it with the --build option.
```
re: down
    @printf "Rebuilding configuration ${name}...\n"
    @docker-compose -f ./docker-compose.yml up -d --build
```

## Step 7: Clean Up the Configuration
- add a clean step to remove unused images and free up disk space. This won't affect running containers.
- The docker system prune -a command removes unused Docker objects such as images, containers, and networks that are not being used by any running containers.
```
clean: down
    @printf "Cleaning configuration ${name}...\n"
    @docker system prune -a
```

## Step 8: Perform a Full Clean
- completely remove all Docker containers, networks, volumes, and images, define an fclean section for deep cleaning.
- This command stops all containers, removes all images, networks, and volumes. Use this with caution, as it will wipe everything Docker-related from your system.
```
fclean:
    @printf "Performing a full clean of all configurations...\n"
    @docker stop $$(docker ps -qa)
    @docker system prune --all --force --volumes
    @docker network prune --force
    @docker volume prune --force
```

## Step 9: Making the Makefile More Convenient
- To ensure that your targets donâ€™t interfere with file names, you can mark them as "phony." Add this at the end of your Makefile: ``` .PHONY: all build down re clean fclean ```

## Final Makefile
```
name = simple_nginx_html

all:
    @printf "Launching configuration ${name}...\n"
    @docker-compose -f ./docker-compose.yml up -d

build:
    @printf "Building configuration ${name}...\n"
    @docker-compose -f ./docker-compose.yml up -d --build

down:
    @printf "Stopping configuration ${name}...\n"
    @docker-compose -f ./docker-compose.yml down

re: down
    @printf "Rebuilding configuration ${name}...\n"
    @docker-compose -f ./docker-compose.yml up -d --build

clean: down
    @printf "Cleaning configuration ${name}...\n"
    @docker system prune -a

fclean:
    @printf "Performing a full clean of all configurations...\n"
    @docker stop $$(docker ps -qa)
    @docker system prune --all --force --volumes
    @docker network prune --force
    @docker volume prune --force

.PHONY: all build down re clean fclean
```
