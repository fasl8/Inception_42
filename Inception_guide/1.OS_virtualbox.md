# Step 1. Download
- download the Debian operating system: https://www.debian.org/
  ## What is Debian?
  - Debian is a free, open-source operating system that uses the Linux kernel. It stability, security, and large software repository, for servers, desktops, and embedded systems.
  - ISO images: These are files that you can use to create bootable USB drives or CDs/DVDs to install Debian on your computer.
  - Installation guides: Step-by-step instructions to help you install and configure Debian on your hardware.
  - Live images: These allow you to run Debian from a USB drive without installing it, so you can try it out first.
  ## What Does Debian Do?
  - Operating System: Debian provides the basic software needed to run your computer, including the Linux kernel, a graphical user interface, system libraries, and utilities.
  - Software Repository: It offers access to thousands of free software packages, allowing you to install and update applications easily using package managers like apt-get.
  - Security and Stability: Debian is known for its strong focus on security and stability, making it an excellent choice for servers and critical applications.
# Step 2. Launch
  ## 2.1 Creating a virtual machine
  - Create a new virtual machine
  ![1](https://github.com/fasl8/Inception_42/blob/main/screenshot_step/1.os_virtualbox/2.0_Tools.png)
  - Name your project: Debian
  - Set the correct system configuration: /goinfre/[username], The /goinfre directory is often used in environments where space is limited, enough space allocated for the VMâ€™s needs
  - Type: Linux, the type of operating system you are installing on your VM
  - Version: Debian(64bit), taking full advantage of modern processors and memory addressing, can handle more memory 
  ![2](https://github.com/fasl8/Inception_42/blob/main/screenshot_step/1.os_virtualbox/2.1_Creating_VM.png)
  # 2.2 Resource Allocation
  - The RAM for the project can be allocated from 512 MB if the PC has 4-8 GB to 4096 MB
    ![3](https://github.com/fasl8/Inception_42/blob/main/screenshot_step/1.os_virtualbox/2.2_1Memory_size.png)
  - select the format VDI, Efficient use of disk space.Ability to save and revert to different VM states.Easy to resize and convert to other formats if necessary.
    ![H](https://github.com/fasl8/Inception_42/blob/main/screenshot_step/1.os_virtualbox/2.2_2Hard_disk.png)
    ![4](https://github.com/fasl8/Inception_42/blob/main/screenshot_step/1.os_virtualbox/2.2_3Hard_disk_file_type.png)
  - select a dynamic format and allocate 40 gigabytes for the disk, you are specifying the maximum size that the virtual disk can grow to.
    ![f](https://github.com/fasl8/Inception_42/blob/main/screenshot_step/1.os_virtualbox/2.2_5File_location_and_size.png)
    ![5](https://github.com/fasl8/Inception_42/blob/main/screenshot_step/1.os_virtualbox/2.2_4Storage_on_physical_hard_disk.png)
  - Setting the scale factor to 300% , scale factor is a percentage that determines how much the virtual machine's display should be scaled compared to its native resolution. It essentially zooms in or out on the VM's display to fit better on your physical screen.

# Step 3. Installation
  # 3.1 Starting the installation
  - add the [disk file](https://github.com/fasl8/Inception_42/blob/main/step.md#step-1-download) if you dont hae it choose the [folder](https://github.com/fasl8/Inception_42/blob/main/screenshot_step/1.os_virtualbox/3.1_2new_virtual_option_disk1.png) then [add](https://github.com/fasl8/Inception_42/blob/main/screenshot_step/1.os_virtualbox/3.1_2new_virtual_option_disk2.png) it
  ![7](https://github.com/fasl8/Inception_42/blob/main/screenshot_step/1.os_virtualbox/3.1_1virtual_option_disk.png)
  - greeted by the installation menu. I choose a regular installer, but if you want, you can use a graphical one, it's a matter of taste.

  # 3.2 Selecting language and location
  ![9](https://github.com/fasl8/Inception_42/blob/main/screenshot_step/1.os_virtualbox/3.2_1language.png)

  ![11](https://github.com/fasl8/Inception_42/blob/main/screenshot_step/1.os_virtualbox/3.2_3location.png)
  - leave English as the base locale:

  ![14](https://github.com/fasl8/Inception_42/blob/main/screenshot_step/1.os_virtualbox/3.2_6keyboard.png)
  # 3.3 Setting up the host and users
  - the system will prompt you to select a host name. You can call the host inception
  ![15](https://github.com/fasl8/Inception_42/blob/main/screenshot_step/1.os_virtualbox/3.3_1hostname.png)
  - skip the domain name, leaving the line empty.
  ![16](https://github.com/fasl8/Inception_42/blob/main/screenshot_step/1.os_virtualbox/3.3_2domainname.png)
  - The system will prompt us to set the superuser name (root).
  ![17](https://github.com/fasl8/Inception_42/blob/main/screenshot_step/1.os_virtualbox/3.3_3rootpassword.png)
  - name the regular user somehow. I enter my nickname in the intro:
  ![18](https://github.com/fasl8/Inception_42/blob/main/screenshot_step/1.os_virtualbox/3.3_4username.png)
  - I accept the same name as the account name
  ![19](https://github.com/fasl8/Inception_42/blob/main/screenshot_step/1.os_virtualbox/3.3_5useraccount.png)
  - enter a simple password
  ![20](https://github.com/fasl8/Inception_42/blob/main/screenshot_step/1.os_virtualbox/3.3_5userpassword.png)
  # 3.4 Disk Partitioning
  - the partitioning program will start. We don't need to go into the details of the Linux file system, so we choose use entire diskto use the entire disk.
  ![20](https://github.com/fasl8/Inception_42/blob/main/screenshot_step/1.os_virtualbox/3.4_1partition_disks.png)
  - We select the only virtual disk available to us:
  ![21](https://github.com/fasl8/Inception_42/blob/main/screenshot_step/1.os_virtualbox/3.4_2partition_disks.png)
  - We choose to store all files in one section:
  ![22](https://github.com/fasl8/Inception_42/blob/main/screenshot_step/1.os_virtualbox/3.4_3partition_disks.png)
  - we give the command to complete the marking and write the changes to disk:
  ![23](https://github.com/fasl8/Inception_42/blob/main/screenshot_step/1.os_virtualbox/3.4_4partition_disks.png)
  - We confirm the seriousness of our intentions:
  ![24](https://github.com/fasl8/Inception_42/blob/main/screenshot_step/1.os_virtualbox/3.4_5partition_disks.png)
  # 3.5 Installing the base system
  - I will describe only those steps that are important to us, the rest of the actions can be skipped by clickingenter

  ![26](https://github.com/fasl8/Inception_42/blob/main/screenshot_step/1.os_virtualbox/3.5_3installing.png)
  # 3.6.1 Selecting software
  - We only need the ssh server, so we use space to uncheck everything else.
  - We will install the lighter openbox as a graphical environment later(we will only need it to open our site)
  - We also do not need system utilities.
   ![27](https://github.com/fasl8/Inception_42/blob/main/screenshot_step/1.os_virtualbox/3.6.1_1Software_selection.png)
  - Eventually the system will finally tell us that it wants to install the system bootloader into the main partition:
   ![28](https://github.com/fasl8/Inception_42/blob/main/screenshot_step/1.os_virtualbox/3.6.1_2grub-pc.png)
  - We select a section (we have only one):
   ![29](https://github.com/fasl8/Inception_42/blob/main/screenshot_step/1.os_virtualbox/3.6.1configuring_grub-pc.png)
  - We accept the offer to complete the installation:
   ![30](https://github.com/fasl8/Inception_42/blob/main/screenshot_step/1.os_virtualbox/3.7finish.png)
   ![31](https://github.com/fasl8/Inception_42/blob/main/screenshot_step/1.os_virtualbox/3.7finishinstall.png)
