 # Step 1: Introduction to Docker and Nginx
    
- We are setting up a Docker environment that will house an Nginx web server. Docker allows us to create lightweight containers that are isolated from the host machine, ensuring that we have a clean, controlled environment for running our applications.

- Containers are efficient because they don’t require a full operating system like virtual machines do. By using Docker containers, we ensure that our application is portable, easy to deploy, and doesn't interfere with other software on the machine.

| Technology | Purpose                                      | Ports |
|------------|----------------------------------------------|-------|
| Nginx      | Proxy web server                             | 443   |
| PHP        | Scripting language for web development       | -     |
| Php-Fpm    | FastCGI process manager for PHP              | 9000  |
| WordPress  | Content Management System (CMS)              | -     |
| MariaDB    | Relational Database Management System        | 3306  |
   
## 1. Nginx: The Web Server
- Nginx acts as a reverse proxy server, meaning it routes client requests (typically coming from browsers) to appropriate backend services (e.g., WordPress running with PHP).
- Nginx is lightweight, highly efficient, and can handle large numbers of simultaneous requests. It’s perfect for high-traffic websites and ensures that your web application runs smoothly. This server is particularly well-suited for high loads, making it essential for projects like ours where performance is a priority.
- Port 443: This is the default port for HTTPS, ensuring that your site uses SSL (Secure Socket Layer) for encrypted, secure communication.

## 2. PHP: The Scripting Language
- PHP is a server-side scripting language designed specifically for web development. It powers dynamic websites, meaning it can generate content based on user interactions or stored data.
- Many popular platforms, like WordPress, are built on PHP. By using PHP, we can build and manage dynamic pages for our web project.

## 3. PHP-FPM: FastCGI Process Manager
- PHP-FPM (FastCGI Process Manager) is a handler that helps Nginx and PHP work together. It enables Nginx to serve PHP files efficiently by processing PHP requests faster.
- PHP-FPM speeds up the process of serving PHP files, making your website more responsive. It also supports many advanced features, like error logging and process management, making your PHP environment stable and secure.
- Port 9000: This is the default port for PHP-FPM and is where Nginx will send PHP-related requests.

## 4. WordPress: Content Management System (CMS)
- WordPress is a CMS that simplifies the creation and management of websites without needing to manually write HTML or PHP code.
- WordPress is beginner-friendly yet powerful. It allows you to quickly set up a blog or full-featured website. By using it, we can easily add content, manage pages, and handle user interactions.

## 5. MariaDB: The Database
- MariaDB is a relational database that stores all the data for your WordPress site, such as user information, posts, pages, and settings.
- A database is essential for storing and retrieving information. MariaDB is fast, reliable, and open-source, making it an excellent choice for dynamic sites like WordPress.
- Port 3306: This is the default port for MariaDB, where WordPress will communicate to fetch and store its data.

## 6. Linux & Docker: The Foundation
- Linux: The operating system on which our Nginx, PHP, WordPress, and MariaDB containers will run. Linux is fast, reliable, and open-source, making it the backbone of the modern web.
- Docker: Docker is a containerization platform that allows us to package our applications (Nginx, PHP, etc.) into isolated containers. These containers are lightweight and portable, ensuring consistency across different environments.
-  Linux provides stability and performance, while Docker gives us a clean, reproducible environment for our web applications, making deployment easy and scalable.
 
 # Step 2: Setting Up the Nginx Container
  
## 1. Dockerfile for Nginx Container
  - creating a Dockerfile that will define how our Nginx container is built.
  - A Dockerfile is essentially a recipe that tells Docker what to install and how to configure the environment.
  - By using a container, we ensure that Nginx runs in an isolated environment. 
  - go to our nginx folder: ``` cd ~/project/srcs/requirements/nginx/ ```
  - create a Dockerfile in it: ``` nano Dockerfile ```
- 1. FROM Instruction:
    - define the base image using the FROM instruction. This specifies the base operating system our container will run on.
    - We are using Alpine Linux, a lightweight Linux distribution that is perfect for Docker containers because of its small size and speed
    - We specify Alpine 3.16 as the base image because it is stable, lightweight, and commonly used for containerized applications.

> [!NOTE] 
> From subject we are not allowed to specify labels like alpine:latest, which are automatically assigned to the latest versions of alpine in the dockerhub repositories. Therefore, we go to [the official website](https://www.alpinelinux.org/) of the system and see which release is the latest


- 2. RUN Instruction:
    - we install the required software packages inside the container using the RUN instruction.
    - The RUN command creates a new image layer by executing the specified commands.
    - we use the apk package manager (Alpine’s default) to install Nginx.
    - ``` apk update ```: Updates the list of available packages in Alpine repositories.
    -  ``` apk upgrade ```: Upgrades outdated packages that are installed in the container, ensuring you have the latest versions.
    - ``` apk add --no-cache nginx ```: Installs Nginx and avoids storing cache files that are unnecessary after installation, keeping the image small.
    - The RUN instruction helps us install and set up software inside the container. We use apk commands (similar to apt in Ubuntu) to install programs like Nginx. Each time we use RUN, it adds a layer to the container image. This layer saves all the changes (like software installations) permanently.
    - Unlike CMD or ENTRYPOINT, which are used to run programs when the container starts, RUN makes permanent changes to the container, such as installing software, that will stay even after the container is built.
- 3. EXPOSE Instruction:
    - Once Nginx is installed, we need to make sure that the container is ready to handle network traffic. The EXPOSE instruction tells Docker that the container listens on a specific network port.
    - The ``` EXPOSE 443 ``` instruction makes the container listen for HTTPS traffic on port 443. By exposing this port, we ensure that the Nginx container can communicate with the outside world. 
- 4. CMD Instruction
    - Finally, we need to start Nginx when the container is running. This is done with the CMD instruction, which specifies what command should be executed when the container starts up.
    - ``` nginx ```: This is the Nginx web server executable.
    - ``` -g "daemon off;" ```: This tells Nginx to run in the foreground, not as a background service (daemon). This is useful when debugging, as it allows you to see the logs and output directly from the container.
    - in a Docker container, we disable daemon mode with daemon off; because we want Nginx to run in the foreground. This allows us to capture logs and prevent the container from exiting prematurely. If we let Nginx run as a daemon, Docker might think the process has stopped, and it could terminate the container.
```
# Step 1: Define the base image as Alpine Linux
FROM alpine:3.16

# Step 2: Install Nginx with Alpine's apk package manager
RUN apk update && apk upgrade && apk add --no-cache nginx

# Step 3: Expose the HTTPS port (443) for traffic
EXPOSE 443

# Step 4: Run Nginx in the foreground (disable daemon mode)
CMD ["nginx", "-g", "daemon off;"]
```

## 2. Nginx Configuration File
- In the Nginx installation, we have directories like conf and tools.the configuration file for Nginx is placed inside the conf folder.
- we need to create and configure the nginx.conf file. This file tells Nginx how to handle incoming requests and where to send them.
- create our config file: ``` nano conf/nginx.conf ```
    - 1.server block:
        - ``` listen 443 ssl; ```: tells Nginx to listen on port 443, which is used for HTTPS connections.
        - ``` server_name <your_nickname>.42.fr www.<your_nickname>.42.fr; ```: defines the domain name or server name that Nginx will respond to. Replace <your_nickname> with your actual server name.
        - ``` root /var/www/; ```: sets the root directory where Nginx will look for files to serve your website files.
        - ``` index index.php index.html; ```: specifies the default files Nginx will look for, in order (PHP, then HTML).
>[!NOTE]
> we are using port 443 for HTTPS, which is mandatory for secure web communication. By default, websites use port 80 for HTTP, but since we are securing the site with SSL, we will not use port 80 anymore.

   - 2.SSL Configuration:
        - ``` ssl_certificate ```  ```ssl_certificate_key ```: point to the SSL certificate and key files used to secure connections over HTTPS.
        - ``` ssl_protocols TLSv1.2 TLSv1.3; ```: define which SSL/TLS protocols to support for secure connections.
>[!NOTE]
> These paths should point to the actual certificate and key files. Make sure you have valid SSL certificates for your domain.
   - 3.location block:
        - ``` location / ```: handles requests for the root of the website.
        - ``` try_files $uri /index.php?$args /index.html; ```: tries to serve the requested file. If it doesn’t exist, it will fallback to serving index.php or index.html.
        - ``` add_header ```: Adds custom HTTP headers to control caching (we disable caching here for development purposes).
   - 4.PHP Handling (Commented Out):
        - ``` location ~ \.php$ ```: is for handling PHP files using php-fpm (FastCGI).
        - ``` fastcgi_pass wordpress:9000; ```: the PHP-FPM service running in the WordPress container. It listens on port 9000 and handles PHP requests.
>[!NOTE]
> It’s currently commented out because, for testing, we will only serve HTML files. We will uncomment this block later to handle PHP files when we set up WordPress.
```
server {
    listen      443 ssl;
    server_name  <your_nickname>.42.fr www.<your_nickname>.42.fr;
    root    /var/www/;
    index index.php index.html;
    ssl_certificate     /etc/nginx/ssl/<your_nickname>.42.fr.crt;
    ssl_certificate_key /etc/nginx/ssl/<your_nickname>.42.fr.key;
    ssl_protocols       TLSv1.2 TLSv1.3;
    ssl_session_timeout 10m;
    keepalive_timeout 70;
    location / {
        try_files $uri /index.php?$args /index.html;
        add_header Last-Modified $date_gmt;
        add_header Cache-Control 'no-store, no-cache';
        if_modified_since off;
        expires off;
        etag off;
    }
#    location ~ \.php$ {
#        fastcgi_split_path_info ^(.+\.php)(/.+)$;
#        fastcgi_pass wordpress:9000;
#        fastcgi_index index.php;
#        include fastcgi_params;
#        fastcgi_param SCRIPT_FILENAME $document_root$fastcgi_script_name;
#        fastcgi_param PATH_INFO $fastcgi_path_info;
#    }
}
```

- We also need to copy the SSL keys to the correct folder inside our project. We can use this command to copy them: ``` cp ~/project/srcs/requirements/tools/* ~/project/srcs/requirements/nginx/tools/  ```

## 3. Create docker-compose configuration
- Docker-compose is a tool designed to simplify the management of multiple Docker containers.
- It allows you to define and run multi-container Docker applications using a single configuration file, docker-compose.yml. Instead of starting each container manually, you can use one command to start all the containers at once. This makes it easier to manage applications that rely on multiple services (like Nginx and WordPress) working together.
- we need to navigate to the directory where our docker-compose.yml file is located ```  cd ../../ && nano docker-compose.yml ```
    - 1. Specify the Version: ``` version: '3' ```
    - 2. Define Services:
        - a service is a container that runs a specific application
        -  we are defining our nginx service.
    - 3. Build Context and Dockerfile:
        - where Docker should find the Dockerfile to build our Nginx container.
        - ``` context: . ```: the build context is the current directory, Docker will look for the Dockerfile and any other resources relative to this location.
        - ``` dockerfile: requirements/nginx/Dockerfile ```: path to the Dockerfile we created for our Nginx setup.
    - 4.Container Name and Ports:
        - set the name of our container and specify which ports to expose.
        - ``` container_name: nginx: ```: sets a name for our Nginx container to make it easier to reference.
        - ``` ports: - "443:443" ```: port 443 on the host machine to port 443 on the container. Since we are using HTTPS we use port 443.
    - 5.Handling Dependencies:
        - We need to ensure that the Nginx service starts after the WordPress service.
        - ``` depends_on: ```: setting defines dependencies between services. By specifying that nginx depends on wordpress, Docker Compose ensures that the WordPress container starts first. This is crucial because Nginx needs to be able to connect to WordPress once it is up and running.
        >[!NOTE]
        > we will comment this out for now
    - 6.Volume Mounting:
        - make sure that Nginx has access to our configuration files and SSL certificates, as well as the web root directory.
        - ``` volumes: ```: This section defines what directories will be shared between the host and the container.
        - Nginx configuration directory, allowing the container to use our custom configurations.
        - directory containing SSL certificates.
        -  the directory where our website files will reside, allowing Nginx to serve content from that location.
        >[!NOTE]
        > This setup ensures that the container can access our HTML files during testing. Later on, we will replace this with the actual files from the WordPress directory.
    - 7.Restart Policy:
        - how Docker should handle restarting the container.
        - ``` restart: always ```: This setting tells Docker to automatically restart the container if it stops for any reason. It’s useful for ensuring our web server stays up and running.
```
version: '3'

services:
  nginx:
    build:
      context: .
      dockerfile: requirements/nginx/Dockerfile
    container_name: nginx
#    depends_on:
#      - wordpress
    ports:
      - "443:443"
    volumes:
      - ./requirements/nginx/conf/:/etc/nginx/http.d/
      - ./requirements/nginx/tools:/etc/nginx/ssl/
      - /home/${USER}/simple_docker_nginx_html/public/html:/var/www/
    restart: always
```
![5](https://github.com/fasl8/Inception/blob/main/screenshot_step/8.nginx/5.docker-compose.png)
- Before launching the new configuration, we should stop any existing containers that might conflict:
    - stops and removes any running containers defined in the previous docker-compose.yml file, ensuring that we can start fresh with our new configuration.
    - ``` cd ~/simple_docker_nginx_html/ ```
    - ``` docker-compose down ```
![6](https://github.com/fasl8/Inception/blob/main/screenshot_step/8.nginx/6.stop.png)
- To launch our new Docker Compose setup, navigate back to the project directory and run:
    - starts all the containers defined in the docker-compose.yml file in detached mode (in the background).
    - ``` cd ~/project/srcs/  ```
    - ``` docker-compose up -d ```
![7](https://github.com/fasl8/Inception/blob/main/screenshot_step/8.nginx/7.run.png)
- Since we are using port 443 for HTTPS, you can now access your Nginx server through a web browser at:
    - ``` https://127.0.0.1 ```
    - ``` https://<your_nickname>.42.fr ```
